Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 🐍
📚 Overview
This repository provides a collection of Python examples that illustrate key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Dive into how to use classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to write clean, modular, and maintainable code.

🔍 Concepts Covered
1. Classes and Objects 📦
Classes: Blueprints for creating objects. Define attributes and methods.
Objects: Instances of classes with specific values and behaviors.
Example: class Person: defines a person with attributes like name and age and methods like greet().

2. Inheritance 🧬
Inheritance: Mechanism to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting attributes and methods.
Example: class Student(Person): extends the Person class to include student-specific attributes and methods.

3. Encapsulation 🔒
Encapsulation: Hides the internal state of an object and only exposes a controlled interface. Uses private and protected attributes.
Example: Using self.__private_var to restrict access to internal attributes.

4. Polymorphism 🧩
Polymorphism: Allows methods to do different things based on the object’s class. Implemented through method overriding.
Example: class Animal: with a method make_sound(), and class Dog(Animal): overriding make_sound() to bark.
